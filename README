#=============================================================


# - This project is for monitoring a sample application server.
# - It sets up Prometheus Node Exporter for metrics collection
# and configures a mock application (Titan App) to simulate load.

# - It also installs Grafana Alloy for metrics and log collection.
# - Prometheus for metrics scraping, Loki for logs, and Grafana for visualization.
# - Alloy was used to upload logs to Loki.
    
# I made the setup using Terraform X AWS to provision the infrastructure.
# provisioned infrastructure includes:
# - EC2 as Servers
# - Security Groups for firewall rules
# - Route53 for DNS management


# Note: If ran in github actions, update the security group ingress rules to your actual IP.
